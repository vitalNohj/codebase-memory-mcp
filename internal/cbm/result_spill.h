/*
 * result_spill.h — per-file extraction results parked on disk when the
 * memory budget is hit.
 *
 * A compacted CBMFileResult is one exact-size arena block plus a header whose
 * pointers all point into that block (cbm_result_compact guarantees it). That
 * makes a result a relocatable blob: written as header + block, read back at
 * any address by shifting every pointer by the base delta. The store is one
 * append-only file per writer thread under the cache directory; loads use
 * pread and are safe from any thread. Nothing here decides WHEN to spill --
 * the pipeline does, on the budget signal (see cbm_pipeline_ctx_t.spill).
