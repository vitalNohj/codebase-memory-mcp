# The code-scanning gate must FAIL CLOSED.
#
# History. `codeql-gate` in .github/workflows/_security.yml counted open alerts
# with:
#
#   ALERTS=$(gh api '.../code-scanning/alerts?state=open' --jq 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
#
# That reads as defensive and is the exact opposite. The job declared no
# `permissions:` block, so it inherited the workflow's `contents: read` and the
# alert API answered 403. `gh` writes the API error BODY to stdout, so `ALERTS`
# became the string
#
#   {"message":"Resource not accessible by integration",...,"status":"403"}0
#
# every `[ ... -gt ... ]` then failed as a non-integer comparison, the `if` took
# its false branch, and the step printed "CodeQL gate passed (0 alerts)" and
# exited 0. Observed live in a GREEN run (34700514102 / job 103571322660), while
# the repository had an open high-severity alert.
#
# A security gate that cannot read its input must stop the build, not wave it
# through. This test pins both halves of that: the permission that makes the
# read possible, and the fail-closed handling for when it still is not.
