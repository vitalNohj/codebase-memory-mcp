# admitted the request under the client's session policy and re-executes the
# worker with the canonical repo_path in its args, so the worker must scope its
# own workspace boundary to that request. Before the fix it built an unscoped
# server, fell back to the process-wide CBM_ALLOWED_ROOT it inherited from the
# daemon starter, and refused every admitted session outside that root with
# "... is outside the allowed root". A missing repo_path must fail closed: a
